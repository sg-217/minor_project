# PocketPilot - Features Documentation

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Features

### 1. OCR Receipt Scanning

**Technology:** Tesseract.js

**How it works:**
1. User uploads receipt image (JPG/PNG/PDF)
2. Image is preprocessed for better accuracy (grayscale, sharpen, normalize)
3. OCR extracts text from image
4. Smart parser extracts:
   - Amount (multiple patterns for â‚¹, Rs, rupees)
   - Date (various formats)
   - Vendor name (from top of receipt)
   - Line items with prices

**Usage:**
- Click "Scan Receipt" button in Expenses page
- Upload receipt photo
- System automatically creates expense with extracted data

**Accuracy Tips:**
- Use clear, well-lit photos
- Ensure receipt is flat and readable
- Avoid shadows and reflections

### 2. Smart Categorization (ML + NLP)

**Technology:** Natural.js + Compromise.js

**Intelligent Features:**
- **Semantic Understanding:** Goes beyond exact keyword matching
- **Context Awareness:** Uses amount and vendor context
- **Multi-language Support:** Understands various expressions
- **Learning Capability:** Can learn from user corrections

**How it categorizes:**

1. **Keyword Matching:** Direct matches from extensive keyword database
2. **Stemming:** Recognizes word variations (rent, rented, rental)
3. **Entity Recognition:** Identifies places, businesses, concepts
4. **Amount Heuristics:** 
   - Large amounts (>â‚¹5000) â†’ likely rent
   - Small amounts (<â‚¹1000) â†’ likely food
   - Medium range varies by context
5. **Vendor Pattern Recognition:**
   - "XYZ Apartment" â†’ automatically categorized as rent
   - "ABC Restaurant" â†’ food category
   - "City Hospital" â†’ healthcare

**Supported Categories:**
- Food & Dining
- Transport & Travel
- Utilities (electricity, internet, phone)
- Rent & Housing
- Entertainment & Subscriptions
- Healthcare & Medical
- Shopping & Retail
- Education
- Personal Care
- Celebrations & Events
- Emergency Expenses
- Other

**Example:**
Input: "â‚¹12,000 to Green Valley Apartments"
Output: Category = "rent" (high confidence)

### 3. Predictive Analytics

**Algorithm:** Custom time-series analysis + pattern recognition

**Predicts Two Types of Expenses:**

**A. Regular/Recurring Expenses:**
- Analyzes last 6 months of data
- Identifies recurring patterns (monthly bills, subscriptions)
- Calculates trends (increasing/decreasing)
- Predicts next month amount based on:
  - Historical average
  - Trend direction
  - Seasonal factors

**B. Irregular Expenses:**
- Medical emergencies
- Celebrations (birthdays, weddings)
- Travel
- Home repairs
- Festival expenses

**How it works:**
1. Calculates frequency of irregular expenses
2. Checks for seasonal patterns (festivals, holidays)
3. Estimates probability of occurrence
4. Predicts likely amount if occurs

**Insights Generated:**
- "Your food expenses are trending upward"
- "High probability of celebration expense next month"
- "Predicted spending is 10% higher than last month"

**Confidence Levels:**
- High: 50+ historical transactions
- Medium: 20-49 transactions
- Low: <20 transactions

### 4. Goal-Oriented Budgeting

**Dynamic Budget System:**

**Features:**
1. **Goal Setting:**
   - Set target amount
   - Define deadline
   - Choose priority level

2. **Automatic Calculations:**
   - Monthly contribution required
   - Days remaining
   - Progress percentage

3. **Smart Recommendations:**
   - Analyzes last 3 months spending
   - Identifies non-essential categories
   - Suggests 20% reduction in:
     - Entertainment
     - Shopping
     - Dining out
   - Calculates total potential savings

4. **Budget Adjustment:**
   - Shows current monthly spending
   - Recommends target spending
   - Category-wise reduction plan

**Example Scenario:**
```
Goal: Buy laptop (â‚¹60,000)
Deadline: 6 months
Current savings: â‚¹10,000

System calculates:
- Required monthly: â‚¹8,333
- Current spending: â‚¹30,000/month
- Suggests reducing:
  * Entertainment: â‚¹2,000 â†’ â‚¹1,600
  * Shopping: â‚¹5,000 â†’ â‚¹4,000
  * Dining: â‚¹3,000 â†’ â‚¹2,400
- Total potential savings: â‚¹9,000/month âœ…
```

### 5. Voice Assistant

**Technology:** Web Speech API (Built-in browser feature - FREE!)

**Capabilities:**

**A. Add Expenses:**

**How it works:**
1. User clicks microphone button
2. Browser's speech recognition starts
3. User speaks command
4. System parses command using NLP
5. Executes action (add expense, query data)
6. Responds with voice + text feedback

**Supported Patterns:**
```javascript
// Add expense
"add [amount] rupees for [category]"
